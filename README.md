# Bootcamp Challenge Week 1
# Adding Accesibility Features to Pre-Existing Code

## Description

The goal of this project was to update the existing code of a website to improve accesibility. I did this by replacing generic div tags with semantic HTML tags, adding alt text to images, and cleaning up the CSS stylesheet to group identically-styled elements together.


## Usage

The webpages is available to view [here](https://distractabee.github.io/challenge-wk-1/)
